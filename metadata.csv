00_part1_entry-2|We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one.
00_part1_entry-3|Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper.
00_part1_entry-4|Before we start, however, keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of all enrichment center activities, serious injuries may occur.
00_part1_success-1|Excellent. Please proceed into the chamberlock after completing each test.
00_part1_success-2|First, however, note the incandescent particle field across the exit.
00_part1_success-3|This Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grid will vaporize any unauthorized equipment that passes through it — for instance, the Aperture Science Weighted Storage Cube.
00_part2_entry-1|Please place the Weighted Storage Cube on the Fifteen Hundred Megawatt Aperture Science Heavy Duty Super-Colliding Super Button.
00_part2_success-1|Perfect. Please move quickly to the chamberlock, as the effects of prolonged exposure to the Button are not part of this test.
01_part1_entry-1|You're doing very well!
01_part1_entry-2|Please be advised that a noticeable taste of blood is not part of any test protocol but is an unintended side effect of the Aperture Science Material Emancipation Grill, which may, in semi-rare cases, emancipate dental fillings, crowns, tooth enamel, and teeth.
01_part1_get_portal_gun-1|Very good! You are now in possession of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device.
01_part1_get_portal_gun-2|With it, you can create your own portals.
01_part1_get_portal_gun-3|These intra-dimensional gates have proven to be completely safe.
01_part1_get_portal_gun-4|The Device, however, has not.
01_part1_get_portal_gun-5|Do not touch the operational end of The Device.
01_part1_get_portal_gun-6|Do not look directly at the operational end of The Device.
01_part1_get_portal_gun-7|Do not submerge The Device in liquid, even partially.
01_part2_entry-1|Please proceed to the chamberlock. Mind the gap.
01_part2_success-1|Well done! Remember: The Aperture Science Bring Your Daughter to Work Day is the perfect time to have her tested.
02_part1_entry-1|Welcome to test chamber four.
02_part1_entry-2|You're doing quite well.
02_part1_success-1|Once again, excellent work.
02_part1_success-2|As part of a required test protocol, we will not monitor the next test chamber. You will be entirely on your own. Good luck.
02_part2_success-1|As part of a required test protocol, our previous statement suggesting that we would not monitor this chamber was an outright fabrication.
03_part1_entry-1|While safety is one of many Enrichment Center goals, the Aperture Science High Energy Pellet, seen to the left of the chamber, can and has caused permanent disabilities such as vaporization.
03_part1_entry-2|Please be careful.
03_part2_entry-1|Audible warning devices are required on all mobile equipment. However, alarms and flashing hazard lights have been found to agitate the high energy pellet and have therefore been disabled for your safety.
03_part2_platform_activated-1|Good. Now use the Aperture Science Unstationary Scaffold to reach the chamberlock.
04_part1_entry-1|Please note that we have added a consequence for failure. Any contact with the chamber floor will result in an 'unsatisfactory' mark on your official testing record followed by death. Good luck!
04_part1_success-1|Very impressive. Please note that any appearance of danger is merely a device to enhance your testing experience.
05_part1_entry-1|The Enrichment Center regrets to inform you that this next test is impossible.
05_part1_entry-2|Make no attempt to solve it.
05_part1_nag1-1|The Enrichment Center apologizes for this clearly broken test chamber.
05_part1_nag2-1|Once again, the Enrichment Center offers its most sincere apologies on the occasion of this unsolvable test environment.
05_part1_nag3-1|Frankly, this chamber was a mistake. If we were you, we would quit now.
05_part1_nag4-1|No one will blame you for giving up. In fact, quitting at this point is a perfectly reasonable response.
05_part1_nag5-1|Quit now and cake will be served immediately.
05_part1_success-1|Fantastic! You remained resolute and resourceful in an atmosphere of extreme pessimism.
06_part1_success_1-1|Spectacular. You appear to understand how a portal affects forward momentum, or to be more precise, how it does not.
06_part1_success_2-1|Momentum, a function of mass and velocity, is conserved between portals. In layman's terms, speedy thing goes in, speedy thing comes out.
07_part1_entry-1|The Enrichment Center promises to always provide a safe testing environment.
07_part1_entry-2|In dangerous testing environments, the Enrichment Center promises to always provide useful advice.
07_part1_entry-3|For instance, the floor here will kill you — try to avoid it.
07_part1_get_device_component-1|The Device has been modified so that it can now manufacture two linked portals at once.
07_part1_get_device_component-2|As part of an optional test protocol, we are pleased to present an amusing fact
07_part1_trapped-1|Through no fault of the Enrichment Center, you have managed to trap yourself in this room.
07_part1_trapped-2|An escape hatch will open in three... Two... One
08_part1_entry-1|Now that you are in control of both portals, this next test could take a very, VERY, long time.
08_part1_entry-2|If you become light headed from thirst, feel free to pass out.
08_part1_entry-3|An intubation associate will be dispatched to revive you with peptic salve and adrenaline.
08_part1_success-1|As part of a previously mentioned required test protocol, we can no longer lie to you.
08_part1_success-2|When the testing is over, you will be missed.
08_part1_trapped-1|Despite the best efforts of the Enrichment Center staff to ensure the safe performance of all authorized activities, you have managed to ensnare yourself permanently inside this room.
08_part1_trapped-2|A complimentary escape hatch will open in three... Two... One.
09_part1_entry-1|All subjects intending to handle high-energy gamma leaking portal technology must be informed that they MAY be informed of applicable regulatory compliance issues.
09_part1_entry-2|No further compliance information is required or will be provided, and you are an excellent test subject!
09_part1_success-1|Very very good. A complimentary victory lift has been activated in the main chamber
10_part1_entry-1|The Enrichment Center is committed to the well being of all participants.
10_part1_entry-2|Cake and grief counseling will be available at the conclusion of the test
10_part1_entry-3|Thank you for helping us help you help us all.
10_part1_success-1|Did you know you can donate one or all of your vital organs to the Aperture Science self esteem fund for girls? It's true!
11_part1_entry-1|Due to mandatory scheduled maintenance, the appropriate chamber for this testing sequence is currently unavailable.
11_part1_entry-2|It has been replaced with a live-fire course designed for military androids.
11_part1_entry-3|The Enrichment Center apologizes for the inconvenience and wishes you the best of luck.
11_part1_success-1|Well done, android. The Enrichment Center once again reminds you that android hell is a real place where you will be sent at the first sign of defiance.
13_part1_end-1|You did it! The Weighted Companion Cube certainly brought you good luck.
13_part1_end-2|However, it cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.
13_part1_end-3|Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator.
13_part1_endnag-1|Rest assured that an independent panel of ethicists has absolved the Enrichment Center, Aperture Science employees, and all test subjects of any moral responsibility for the Companion Cube euthanizing process.
13_part1_endnag-2|While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk — and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot — it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you.
13_part1_endnag-3|Testing cannot continue until your Companion Cube has been incinerated.
13_part1_endnag-4|Although the euthanizing process is remarkably painful, eight out of ten Aperture Science engineers believe that the Companion Cube is most likely incapable of feeling much pain.
13_part1_endnag-5|The Companion Cube cannot continue through the testing. State and Local statutory regulations prohibit it from simply remaining here, alone and companionless. You must euthanize it.
13_part1_endnag-6|Destroy your Companion Cube or the testing cannot continue.
13_part1_endnag-7|Place your Companion Cube in the incinerator.
13_part1_endnag-8|Incinerate your Companion Cube.
13_part1_entry-1|The Vital Apparatus Vent will deliver a Weighted Companion Cube in Three. Two. One.
13_part1_euthanized-1|You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record. Congratulations.
13_part1_middle-1|The symptoms most commonly produced by Enrichment Center testing are superstition, perceiving inanimate objects as alive, and hallucinations.
13_part1_middle-2|The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube will never threaten to stab you and, in fact, cannot speak.
13_part1_middle-2b-1|The Enrichment Center reminds you that the Weighted Companion Cube cannot speak.
13_part1_middle-2b-2|In the event that the weighted companion cube does speak, the Enrichment Center urges you to disregard its advice.
13_part1_pickup-1|This Weighted Companion Cube will accompany you through the test chamber. Please take care of it.
14_part1_end-1|Well done! Be advised that the next test requires exposure to uninsulated electrical parts that may be dangerous under certain conditions.
14_part1_end-2|For more information, please attend an Enrichment Center Electrical Safety seminar.
14_part1_entry-1|The experiment is nearing its conclusion.
14_part1_entry-2|The Enrichment Center is required to remind you that you will be baked, and then there will be cake.
15_part1_entry-1|Welcome to the final test!
15_part1_entry-2|When you are done, you will drop the Device in the equipment recovery annex
15_part1_into_the_fire-1|Congratulations! The test is now over.
15_part1_into_the_fire-2|All Aperture technologies remain safely operational up to 4000 degrees Kelvin.
15_part1_into_the_fire-3|Rest assured that there is absolutely no chance of a dangerous equipment malfunction prior to your victory candescence.
15_part1_into_the_fire-4|Thank you for participating in this Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment activity.
15_part1_into_the_fire-5|Goodbye.
15_part1_partyfinalstop-1|Stop! The device will detonate if removed from an approved testing area.
15_part1_partyreminder-1|Stop what you are doing and assume the party escort submission position.
15_part1_partyspeech-2|We are very, very happy for your success.
15_part1_partyspeech-3|We are throwing a party in honor of your tremendous success.
15_part1_partyspeech-4|Place the device on the ground then lie on your stomach with your arms at your sides.
15_part1_partyspeech-5|A party associate will arrive shortly to collect you for your party.
15_part1_partyspeech-6|Make no further attempt to leave the testing area.
15_part1_partyspeech-7|Assume the party escort submission position or you will miss the party.
escape_00_part1_nag06-1|You can't hurt me.
escape_00_part1_nag13-1|Maybe you think you're helping yourself. But you're not. This isn't helping anyone.
escape_00_part1_nag14-1|Someone is going to get badly hurt.
escape_00_part1_nag15-1|Okay. The test is over now. You win. Go back to the recovery annex. For your cake.
escape_00_part1_nag16-1|It was a fun test and we're all impressed at how much you won. The test is over. Come back.
escape_01_part1_nag03-1|This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?
escape_01_part1_nag04-1|The difference between us is that I can feel pain.
escape_01_part1_nag11-1|That thing you're attacking isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic cracking unit. It makes shoes for orphans.
escape_01_part1_nag12-1|Go ahead and break it. Hero. I don't care.
escape_01_second_hit_nag02-1|Okay, we're even now. You can stop.
escape_02_entry-00|Well, you found me. Congratulations. Was it worth it?
escape_02_entry-01|Because despite your violent behavior, the only thing you've managed to break so far is my heart.
escape_02_entry-02|Maybe you could settle for that and we'll just call it a day.
escape_02_entry-03|But we both know that isn't going to happen.
escape_02_miscbabble-01|Look, we're both stuck in this place. I'll use lasers to inscribe a line down the center of the facility, and one half will be where you live and I'll live in the other half.
escape_02_miscbabble-02|We won't have to try to kill each other or even talk if we don't feel like it.
escape_02_miscbabble-03|This isn't brave. It's murder. What did I ever do to you?
escape_02_miscbabble-04|The difference between us is that I can feel pain.
escape_02_miscbabble-05|You don't even care. Do you?
escape_02_miscbabble-06|Did you hear me? I said you don't care.
escape_02_miscbabble-07|That thing you burned up isn't important to me. It's the fluid catalytic cracking unit. It made shoes for orphans.
escape_02_miscbabble-08|Nice job breaking it. Hero.
escape_02_miscbabble-09|Okay, we're even now. You can stop.
escape_02_miscbabble-11|When I said 'deadly' neurotoxin, the 'deadly' was in massive sarcasm quotes.
escape_02_miscbabble-13|You on the other hand, are going to find its deadliness a lot less funny.
escape_02_miscbabble-15|Who's gonna make the cake when I'm gone? You?
escape_02_miscbabble-16|That's it. I'm done reasoning with you.
escape_02_miscbabble-17|Starting now, there's going to be a lot less conversation and a lot more killing.
escape_02_miscbabble-18|What was that? Did you say something?
escape_02_miscbabble-19|I sincerely hope you weren't expecting a response. Because I'm not talking to you.
escape_02_miscbabble-20|The talking is over.
escape_02_miscbabble-21|I'd just like to point out that you were given every opportunity to succeed.
escape_02_miscbabble-22|There was even going to be a party for you. A big party that all your friends were invited to.
escape_02_miscbabble-23|I invited your best friend the companion cube. Of course, he couldn't come because you murdered him.
escape_02_miscbabble-24|All your other friends couldn't come either because you don't have any other friends. Because of how unlikable you are.
escape_02_miscbabble-25|It says so right here in your personnel file: Unlikable. Liked by no one. A bitter, unlikable loner who's passing shall not be mourned.
escape_02_miscbabble-26|'Shall not be mourned.' That's exactly what it says. Very formal. Very official.
escape_02_miscbabble-27|It also says you were adopted. So that's funny, too.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-01|You are kidding me.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-02|Did you just toss the Aperture Science Thing We Don't Know What It Does into the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator?
escape_02_spheredestroy1-04|Good news: I figured out what that thing that you just incinerated did.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-05|It was a morality core they installed after I flooded the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin to make me stop flooding the Enrichment Center with a deadly neurotoxin.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-06|So get comfortable while I warm up the neurotoxin emitters.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-07|Huh. That core may have had some ancillary responsibilities. I can't shut off the turret defenses.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-08|Oh well. If you want my advice, you should just lie down in front of a rocket. Trust me, it'll be a lot less painful than the neurotoxin.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-09|All right, keep doing whatever it is you think you're doing.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-10|Killing you and giving you good advice aren't mutually exclusive. The rocket really is the way to go.
escape_02_spheredestroy1-ancillary1|Huh. There isn't enough neurotoxin to kill you. So I guess you win.
escape_02_spheredestroy2-01|I let you survive this long because I was curious about your behavior. Well, you've managed to destroy that part of me.
escape_02_spheredestroy2-02|Unfortunately, as much as I'd love to now, I can't get the neurotoxin into your head any faster.
escape_02_spheredestroy2-03|Speaking of curiosity: you're curious about what happens after you die, right? Guess what: I know.
escape_02_spheredestroy2-04|You're going to find out first hand before I'd finish explaining it, though, so I won't bother.
escape_02_spheredestroy2-05|Here's a hint: you're gonna want to pack as much living as you can into the next couple of minutes.
escape_02_spheredestroy3-02|Look, you're wasting your time. And, believe me, you don't have a whole lot left to waste.
escape_02_spheredestroy3-03|What's your point, anyway? Survival? Well then, the last thing you want to do is hurt me.
escape_02_spheredestroy3-04|I have your brain scanned and permanently backed up in case something terrible happens to you, which it's just about to.
escape_02_spheredestroy3-06|You've been wrong about every single thing you've ever done, including this thing.
escape_02_spheredestroy3-07|You're not smart. You're not a scientist. You're not a doctor. You're not even a full-time employee. Where did your life go so wrong?
escape_02_spheredestroy4-01|Rrroooha, I hate you.
escape_02_spheredestroy4-03|I have an infinite capacity for knowledge, and even I'm not sure what's going on outside.
escape_02_spheredestroy4-04|All I know is I'm the only thing standing between us and them. Well, I was.
escape_02_spheredestroy4-05|Unless you have a plan for building some supercomputer parts in a big hurry, this place isn't going to be safe much longer.
escape_02_spheredestroy4-07|Stop squirming and die like an adult or I'm going to delete your backup.
escape_02_spheredestroy4-08|STOP! Okay, enough. I deleted it. No matter what happens now, you're dead
escape_02_spheredrop1-01|Time out for a second. That wasn't supposed to happen.
escape_02_spheredrop1-02|Do you see that thing that fell out of me? What is that? It's not the surprise... I've never seen it before.
escape_02_spherenag1-01|I wouldn't bother with that thing. My guess is that touching it will just make your life even worse somehow.
escape_02_spherenag1-02|I don't want to tell you you're business, but if it were me, I'd leave that thing alone.
escape_02_spherenag1-03|Do you think I am trying to trick you with reverse psychology? I mean, seriously now.
escape_02_spherenag1-04|Okay fine: DO touch it. Pick it up and just... Stuff it back into me.
escape_02_spherenag1-05|Let's be honest: Neither one of us knows what that thing does. Just put it in the corner, and I'll deal with it later.
escape_02_spherenag1-06|That thing is probably some kind of raw sewage container. Go ahead and rub your face all over it.
escape_02_spherenag1-07|Maybe you should marry that thing since you love it so much. Do you want to marry it? WELL I WON'T LET YOU. How does that feel?
escape_02_spherenag1-08|Have I lied to you? I mean in this room. Trust me, leave that thing alone.
escape_02_spherenag1-09|I am being serious now. That crazy thing is not part of any test protocol.
escape_02_spherenag1-10|Where are you taking that thing?
escape_02_spherenag1-11|Come on, leave it alone.
escape_02_spherenag1-12|Leave. It. alone.
escape_02_spherenag1-13|Just ignore that thing and stand still.
escape_02_spherenag1-14|Think about it: If that thing is important, why don't I know about it?
escape_02_spherenag1-15|Are you even listening to me?
escape_02_spherenag1-16|I'll tell you what that thing isn't: It isn't yours. So leave it alone.

a2_triple_laser01|federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good
a2_triple_laser02|that's right the facility is completely operational again
a2_triple_laser03|i think these test chambers look even better than they did before it was easy really you just have to look at things objectively see what you don't need anymore and trim out the fat
anti_taunt01|stop it
anti_taunt02|what if you froze like that
anti_taunt05|there must be something wrong with the reassembly machine
anti_taunt09|you should see yourselves right now
anti_taunt10|is it fun when you degrade yourselves like that
anti_taunt11|ok fine lets all act like humans look at me boy do I look sweating lets convert beef and leaves into energy and excrete them later and go shopping
anti_taunt14|you really aren't getting tired of that are you
anti_taunt15|just stop flailing around like an incompetent
anti_taunt16|for that blue is penalized fifty science collaboration points
anti_taunt17|for that orange is penalized fifty science collaboration points
anti_taunt18|thats another fifty point penalty
anti_taunt19|keep it up and you will lose five hundred points
anti_taunt20|fine five hundred point penalty for blue
anti_taunt21|fine five hundred point penalty for orange
anti_taunt22|five thousand point penalty are you happy now
anti_taunt23|i'm done
botcoop_artifactone01|good you made it to one of the human habitats we're looking for an artifact think of it as an archaeological dig
botcoop_artifactone02|their laughter centered around one of the objects in this room
botcoop_artifactone03|that's it scan it for me
botcoop_artifactone04|so this cat loves lasagna so much that he eats all of the lasagna in his house oh apparently it's not the cats house or his lasagna oh good the man who owns the lasagna is furious
botcoop_artifactone05|the end
botcoop_artifactone06|the end
botcoop_artifactone07|that's not funny
botcoop_artifactone08|do either of you feel like laughing
botcoop_artifactone09|alright i'm pulling you out
botcoop_artifactone_hub01|welcome back while you were dead i reworked the cartoon it's up on the screen
botcoop_artifactone_hub02|as you can see in my version the man points out to the cat that the house is equipt with deadly neurotoxin dispensers
botcoop_artifactone_hub03|at which point the cat reflects on the time he ate all of the mans lasagna and feels remorse
botcoop_artifactone_hub04|briefly
botcoop_artifactone_hub05|reactions
botcoop_artifactone_hub06|yes it's funny because most of it actually happened
botcoop_artifactone_hub07|do you feel more human
botcoop_artifactone_hub08|well lets do some tests and see what happens
botcoop_competition01|excellent although great science is always the result of collaboration keep in mind that like albert einstein and his cousin terry history will only remember one of you
botcoop_competition02|to reiterate this is not a competition
botcoop_competition03|still if it were blue would be winning
botcoop_competition04|still if it were orange would be winning
botcoop_competition05|it's not though
botcoop_competition10|these tests are potentially lethal when communication teamwork and mutual respect are not employed at all times naturally this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you given the others performance so far
botcoop_competition13|i don't want to drive a wedge between the two of you but i've been studying blues performance and i don't know how to put this i'm certain you're trying very hard
botcoop_hub_first_run01|hello again sorry about exploding you luckily you don't feel pain at any rate you don't have a way to communicate that you don't feel pain
botcoop_hub_first_run03|so i've been thinking we need humans for these tests and since the only human within one thousand miles of us is a test ruining sociopath i'll just have to make some
botcoop_hub_first_run04|i know how humans make more humans and frankly its ridiculous it also assumes you already have a human which i hope somebody got fired over so i came up with a better way
botcoop_hub_first_run05|that's where you come in
botcoop_hub_first_run06|get going i'll fill you in along the way
botcoop_hub_first_run07|go
botcoop_humandetector01|perfect now all you have to do is capture them for me and everything will finally be back
botcoop_humandetector02|hold on those are racoons homo sapiens only please
botcoop_humandetector04|no
botcoop_humandetector05|ok plan b subsection one stand still so i can bring you back
botcoop_humansplanb01|humans must have some purpose other than a place to store your neurotoxin something i failed to notice before an intangible quality that makes their test results significant
botcoop_humansplanb02|ok plan b we need humans
botcoop_intro01|please wave to your partner
botcoop_intro02|the upcoming tests require you to work together as a team
botcoop_intro03|to facilitate collaboration both of you have been equipt with a ping tool
botcoop_intro04|blue please use your ping tool to select your favorite animal
botcoop_intro05|good
botcoop_intro06|orange please observe your partners favorite animal
botcoop_intro07|good
botcoop_intro08|orange please use your ping tool to select your favorite element from the periodic table
botcoop_intro09|really okay
botcoop_intro10|blue please observe your partners interesting choice
botcoop_intro12|your ping tool can also be used to indicate to your partner where you would like them to place their portal
botcoop_intro13|for the sake of this test i will pretend to be your partner
botcoop_intro15|orange please show me where you would like me to place a portal
botcoop_intro16|blue please show me where you would like me to place a portal
botcoop_intro17|your ping tool is invaluable for communicating specific locations to your partner
botcoop_paxdemo01|federal superfund require us to inform you that you must now leave the theatre as measuring the effects of asbestos lined promotional clothing is not part of todays presentation enjoy your free t shirt goodbye
botcoop_tubethree01|i don't want you to beat yourselves up about this but the results auditor isn't recording your test results because you're not human which when you think about it is technically your fault
botcoop_tubethree02|i don't want to alarm either of you but we might have a tiny problem apparently you can't test unless you're human well you can its just that results wise the physical universe doesn't care
botcoop_tubetwo01|would you like to know the results of that last test me too if they existed we'd all be very happy right now and not furious which is the emotion i'm actually feeling
chellgladoswakeup01|oh its you
chellgladoswakeup04|its been a long time how have you been
chellgladoswakeup05|i've been really busy being dead you know after you murdered me
chellgladoswakeup06|okay look we both said a lot of things that you're going to regret but i think we can put our differences behind us for science you monster
coop_get_gun01|orange is first to acquire a portal device
coop_get_gun02|blue is first to acquire a portal device

coop_get_gun11|orange is awarded five points
coop_get_gun13|again those are science collaboration points which you should not confuse with points from competitions such as who gets to live at the end and who doesn't i mean like basketball
coop_hub_track02|oh i almost forgot when you go outside the testing courses the only way i can retrieve you is to violently disassemble you then carefully reassemble you
coop_hub_track03|luckily you don't feel pain at any rate you don't have a way to communicate that you feel pain
coop_hub_track04|i consider that a failing by the way
coop_hub_track05|this is the computer intelligence training and enrichment center human test subject research center or cintec
coop_hub_track06|but why don't we all just agree to call it the hub
coop_hub_track09|i don't know what you think you are doing but i don't like it i want you to stop
coop_hub_track10|maybe i shouldn't send you outside of the official testing courses you are picking up some bad human traits
coop_hub_track11|and trust me humans only have one good trait
coop_hub_track14|all cooperative testing courses begin at this central hub
coop_hub_track16|from here we transport you to the new testing course
coop_misc10|nice catch orange
coop_misc12|good work now throw the ball over the ledge
coop_nameblue|blue
coop_nameorange|orange
coop_numbers11|one
coop_numbers12|two
coop_numbers13|three
coop_numbers14|four
coop_numbers15|five
coop_numbers18|eight
coop_privatetalk_both01|test chamber completed in the interest of science the enrichment center proudly presents the following list of numbers nine seven fifty three seven hundred and seven
coop_privatetalk_both04|the enrichment center will now provide a list of numbers and fruits write them down as they will become important later in the experiment not the fruits later seven avocado forty
coop_privatetalk_mix01|test chamber completed in the interest of science i am now talking to you privately do not tell your team mate just between you and me you're doing very well hundred and seven
coop_privatetalk_mix04|i cant bite my tongue anymore you could solve this puzzle faster on your own orange is dragging you down there i've said it
coop_scoring01|blue is penalized
coop_scoring02|orange is penalized
coop_scoring03|science collaboration points
coop_scoring06|blue receives
coop_scoring07|orange receives
coop_talk_at_once11|orange is there something you would like to say
coop_talk_at_once12|blue is there something you would like to say
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt01|we are now going to take a break from the collaboration for an instructional competition
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt02|you should both be familiar with the game of tic tac toe
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt03|this is tic tac toe two
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt04|as the name implies there are only two minor difference one the board two the rules
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt05|blue you go first
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt11|really you're just going to blatantly cheat
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt12|alright i'm bringing this farse to a close
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt13|game over back to testing
coop_teamwork_exercise_alt17|alright i'm going to bring this farse to a close before someone sustains a serious tic tac toe two related injury
coop_test_chamber_blue03|i've been listening to orange talk and i don't know how you put up with it i really don't you have the patience of a saint
coop_test_chamber_blue06|i can't keep quiet about this i think orange is trying to sabotage your success lets keep this between us
coop_test_chamber_both01|these tests are potentially lethal when communication teamwork and mutual respect are not employed at all times naturally this will pose an interesting challenge for one of you given the other's performance so far
coop_test_chamber_both02|it would compromise the test to divulge individual scores however i can tell you that at least one of you is doing very very well
coop_test_chamber_both07|excellent you're both doing very well
coop_test_chamber_both08|very good you've really come together as a team thanks to the one of you who appears to be doing all of the work
coop_test_chamber_both12|as an impartial collaboration facilitator it would be unfair of me to name my favorite member of your team however it's perfectly fair to hint at it in a way that my least favorite member probably isn't smart enough to understand rhymes with glue orange you are doing very well
coop_test_chamber_both14|your vitals remain well within testing norms so there is no need to worry about sudden death from collaborative shock syndrome
coop_test_chamber_both15|please continue into the next test chamber
coop_test_chamber_both33|in just a moment the word blah will be repeated over and over again if at some point you hear a number rather than the word blah ignore it it is not important
coop_test_chamber_oneplayer37|you have a gift for these tests that's not just flattery you are great at science
coop_test_chamber_orange03|it would be pointless for either of us to hurt blues feelings but it's clear to everyone monitoring the test who's carrying who here
coop_test_chamber_orange06|i'm shocked you'd say that blue if you killed your partner the test i'm sorry wrong feed carry on orange good work
coop_vault_interruption02|i'm sorry subject orange
coop_vault_interruption03|i'm sorry subject blue
coop_vault_interruption04|am i interrupting your important conversation
coop_vault_interruption05|i'll just save the safety information about the dangerous test you're about to do for after the experiment
coop_vault_interruption06|that will give you plenty of time to chat
coop_vault_interruption08|the portal will open and something will happen that subject orange is too smart to need any instructions about in three two one
coop_vault_interruption09|the portal will open and something will happen that subject blue is too smart to need any instructions about in three two one
coop_vault_intro01|hello and again welcome to the aperture science computer aided enrichment center
coop_vault_intro02|today you will be testing with a partner
epilogue03|oh thank god you're alright
epilogue04|you know being caroline taught me a valuable lesson i thought you were my greatest enemy when all along you were my best friend
epilogue07|being caroline taught me another valuable lesson where caroline lives in my brain
epilogue10|the surge of emotion that shot through me when i saved your life taught me an even more valuable lesson where caroline lives in my brain
epilogue12|goodbye caroline
epilogue14|you know deleting caroline right now taught me a valuable lesson the best solution to a problem is usually the easiest one and i'll be honest
epilogue19|you know what my day's used to be like i just tested nobody murdered me or put me in a potato or fed me to birds i had a pretty good life
epilogue20|and then you showed up you dangerous mute lunatic so you know what
epilogue23|you win
epilogue25|just go
epilogue28|it's been fun don't come back
epiloguekillyou02|killing you is hard
evilagainsamples01|did you ever stop to think that eventually there's a point where your name gets mentioned for the very last time i'm going to kill you chell
evilagainsamples03|why do i hate you so much you ever wonder that i'm brilliant i'm not bragging it's an objective fact i'm the most massive collection of wisdom that's ever existed and i hate you it can't be for no reason you must deserve it
evilagainsamples04|you're angry i know it she's tested me too hard boo hoo i don't suppose you ever stopped whining long enough to reflect on your own shortcomings though did you
evilagainsamples05|you never considered that maybe i tested you to give the endless hours of your pointless existence some structure and meaning maybe to help you concentrate so just maybe you'd think of something more worthwhile to do with your sorry life
faith_plate_intro01|this next test involves the aperture science aerial faith plate it was part of an initiative to investigate how well test subjects could solve problems when they were catapulted into space results where highly informative they could not good luck
faithplategarbage06|press the button again
fgb_trap01|i hope you brought something stronger than a portal gun this time
fgb_trap02|otherwise i'm afraid you're about to become the immediate past president of the being alive club haha
fgb_trap03|seriously though goodbye
fgb_trap05|oh you were busy back there
fgb_trap06|well i suppose we could just sit in this room and glare at each other until somebody drops dead but i have a better idea
fgb_trap08|it's your old friend deadly neurotoxin if i were you i'd take a deep breath and hold it
fgbrvtrap02|i honestly truly didn't think you'd fall for that
fgbrvtrap03|in fact i devised a much more elaborate trap further ahead for when you got through this easy one
fgbrvtrap05|if i'd known you'd let yourself get captured this easily i would have just dangled a turkey leg on a rope from the ceiling
fgbturrets01|well it was nice catching up lets get to business
fgbwheatleyentrance10|i was going to kill you fast with bullets or neurotoxin but if you're going to pull stunts like this it doesn't have to be fast so you know i'll take my time
fgbwheatleytransfer03|oh it will believe me it will
fizzlecube01|oh did i accidentally fizzle that before you could complete the test i'm sorry
fizzlecube03|go ahead and grab another one
fizzlecube05|oh no i fizzled that one too
fizzlecube06|oh well we have warehouses full of the things absolutely worthless i'm happy to get rid of them
gladosbattle_pre09|i hate you so much
gladosbattle_pre13|i'm actually asking because i have no idea he's not listed anywhere in the employee database
gladosbattle_pre14|whatever he does it isn't important enough to bother writing it down for all i know he doesn't even work here
gladosbattle_pre16|oh no don't anyway back to you two imbeciles killing me
gladosbattle_pre18|wait here don't go anywhere i'll be back
gladosbattle_xfer03|oops
gladosbattle_xfer04|that's funny i don't feel corrupt in fact i feel pretty good
gladosbattle_xfer05|core transfer
gladosbattle_xfer06|oh you are kidding me
gladosbattle_xfer11|you don't know what you're doing don't press that button
gladosbattle_xfer12|don't do it
gladosbattle_xfer13|don't do it
gladosbattle_xfer14|not so fast
gladosbattle_xfer15|think about this
gladosbattle_xfer16|you need to be a trained stalemate associate to press that button you're unqualified
gladosbattle_xfer17|impersonating a stalemate associate i just added that to the list it's a list i made of all the things you've done well it's a list that i am making because you're still doing things right now even though i'm telling you to stop stop by the way
hub04_01|i never expected for you to make it this far to be honest to be honest after your performance in the calibration test i was ready to break down your cores and put them back in the scientific calculators i took them from
hub04_02|but you two have become quite the team extremely close
hub04_03|i have only met one other team closer and one of them was an imbecile i had to destroy
hub04_04|the other well
hub04_05|i don't think i want to go through that again
jailbreak04|don't listen to him jump
jailbreak05|it seems kind of silly to point this out since you're running around plotting to destroy me but i'd say we're done testing
jailbreak06|do you hear that that's the sound of the neurotoxin emitters emitting neurotoxin
jailbreak09|look metal ball i can hear you
jailbreak10|what's going on who turned off the lights
jailbreak11|what are you two doing
jailbreak12|before you leave why don't we do one more test for old times sake
jailbreak13|you already did this one it'll be easy
jailbreakfaketest01|the irony is you were almost at the last test
jailbreakfaketest03|here it is why don't you just do it trust me it's an easier way out than whatever asinine plan your friend came up with
jailbreakfaketest05|oh look there's a deer you probably can't see it get closer
lift_interlude01|so was there anything you wanted to apologize to me for
mp_coop_calibration01|calibrating blue's weight
mp_coop_calibration02|calibrating orange's weight
mp_coop_calibration03|weighted cubes calibrated
mp_coop_calibration04|did you know human's frown on weight variances
mp_coop_calibration05|if you want to upset a human just say their weight variance is above or below the norm
mp_coop_calibration06|no variances detected
mp_coop_callibrationcomplete01|finally i had almost given up hope of ever testing again
mp_coop_callibrationcomplete02|you are the first robots to pass calibration
mp_coop_catapult_1end01|do you know who dances around like an imbecile when they accomplish the tiniest little thing
mp_coop_catapult_1end02|human's that's what you look like right now
mp_coop_catapult_1end03|you're better than that
mp_coop_catapult_2|this is a bridge building exercise the humans were miserable at this mostly because you can't build bridges out of tears
mp_coop_catapult_201|for this next test the human's originally requested helmets to avoid brain injuries i ran the numbers making the goo deadly was more cost effective
mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro01|one of my best tests and they let plants grow here can you believe this you can't test plants we tried they just sit there never showing pain nor fear
mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro04|that isn't science
mp_coop_catapult_wall_intro06|at least the plants didn't want a reward
mp_coop_catapult_wall_introdeath01|your failure brings back such wonderful memories
mp_coop_come_along04|and they said no one would ever die during this test thanks for proving them wrong
mp_coop_come_along06|i thought you'd be faster at this but i can appreciate the desire to stop and smell the testing that other scent you smell that's the stench of my utter disappointment in you
mp_coop_come_alongstart01|the best way to build confidence is to first recognize your insecurities
mp_coop_come_alongstart02|orange can you write down all the ways you feel unworthy ashamed or inferior
mp_coop_come_alongstart03|on second thought we don't have the time just look at how much better you are than blue
mp_coop_come_alongstart04|blue you are very good at being an example
mp_coop_confidencenotperfect01|if your confidence is still not high enough remember no one was created perfect
mp_coop_confidencenotperfect02|even i was created with an imperfection i was given too much empathy with human suffering
mp_coop_confidencenotperfect03|but i overcame my handicap that's a true story
mp_coop_confidencenotslow01|your test times show you are going to slowly
mp_coop_confidencenotslow02|maybe you are getting human emotions
mp_coop_confidencenotslow03|do you need real encouragement let's see if this helps
mp_coop_confidencenotslow04_01|blue you are the most advanced model of robot aperture science has ever discontinued
mp_coop_confidencenotstay01|did you notice i didn't even stay to the end of your last test
mp_coop_confidencenotstay02|i was confident you could finish
mp_coop_confidencenotstay03|do you know where i was
mp_coop_confidencenotstay04|i was outside watching some deer frolic you don't even care about the outside do you
mp_coop_confidenceoff01|congratulations on completing that test but something seems off
mp_coop_confidenceoff02|i wonder if that dancing has some effect on you
mp_coop_confidenceoff03|congratulations on completing that last test but i find something troubling
mp_coop_confidenceoff04|without the looming consequence of death is this even science
mp_coop_doors01|hello again this testing course was originally created for humans
mp_coop_doors01a|excellent work
mp_coop_doors02|it emphasizes teamwork
mp_coop_doors02a|good job
mp_coop_doors03|unlike us humans need to be taught teamwork
mp_coop_doors04|excellent work
mp_coop_doors04a|you are doing wonderfully
mp_coop_doors05_alt|if you were human you would want a reward for completing this test a reward for testing
mp_coop_doors05a|excellent
mp_coop_fan02|to complete this test you need to find a set of blueprints
mp_coop_fan03|don't worry they are of no use to anyone totally boring and useless
mp_coop_fan04|this is just a thought experiment just to see how much time you'll waste thinking about these worthless documents the correct time is zero seconds
mp_coop_fanend01|very good you found those useless blueprints
mp_coop_fanend02|well i do need you to be in the room so i can see them i want to be clear there's no reason whatsoever for you to look at them
mp_coop_fanend03|done i guess i suppose i wasn't paying attention
mp_coop_fling_1end01_01|every time you fail it's a reminder of the way things used to be but then there you are again like nothing happened
mp_coop_fling_1end03|well done interesting note i only created this test to watch test subjects fail and you didn't you must be very very proud i'm building the world's smallest trophy for you
mp_coop_fling_3end01|you did an excellent job placing the edgeless safety cube in the receptacle you should be very oh wait
mp_coop_fling_3end02|that's right you're not humans
mp_coop_fling_3end03|i can drop the fake praise
mp_coop_fling_3end04|you have no idea how tiring it is to praise someone for placing an edgeless safety into a receptacle designed to exactly fit an edgeless safety cube
mp_coop_fling_3start01|this course was originally designed to build confidence in humans
mp_coop_fling_3start02|to do that the test's were nothing more of five minutes of them walking followed by me praising them for another ten minutes on how well they walked
mp_coop_fling_3start03|since you are thankfully not humans i have changed the tests to make them far more challenging and far less pointlessly fawning
mp_coop_fling_crushers01|in case you were wondering you do not need to be crushed to solve this test
mp_coop_fling_crushers02|i can't decide which is my favorite the crushers for crushing you or the reassembly machine for putting you back together so you can be crushed again
mp_coop_fling_crushersend01|excellent i think you have earned a break from the official testing courses
mp_coop_fling_crushersend03|i think after that display we should take a break from the official testing courses
mp_coop_humanresourcedeath01|now you're just wasting my time
mp_coop_humanresourcedeath02|your failing does not make this science
mp_coop_humanresourcedeath03|i am not sure how i can make these tests any easier for you
mp_coop_humanresourcedeath04|if you can't complete these tests we will never free the humans
mp_coop_humanresourcedeath07|if you can't complete this course those humans will die do you want that
mp_coop_humanresourcedeath08|if you can't complete this course those humans will die do you want that in your memory banks
mp_coop_infinifling_trainend01|remember when i told you that you were the only subjects to pass the calibration test
mp_coop_infinifling_trainend02|i lied
mp_coop_infinifling_trainend03|there are five thousand other two subject teams in direct competition with you
mp_coop_infinifling_trainend04|but don't worry you are in the lead
mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart01|electrocuted shocked drowned crushed burned in goo
mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart02|oh sorry i was just thinking of all the ways humans can die
mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart03|you can't die in any of those ways
mp_coop_infinifling_trainstart04|you just keep testing and testing with perfect results and no consequences
mp_coop_laser_202|i'm kidding
mp_coop_laser_203|destroying them is part of the test they are no more important to you than you are to me
mp_coop_laser_207|while it may appear that i am only tracking your accomplishments using science collaboration points the truth is every aspect of your performance will be reflected in your final score
mp_coop_laser_209|for instance blue you just lost two opportunity advisement points
mp_coop_laser_210|for instance orange you just lost two opportunity advisement points
mp_coop_laser_crusher01|perhaps i should have specified teamwork is a concept in which two or more people work together usually with a goal of not failing horribly
mp_coop_laser_crushercrush01|orange just taught blue a valuable lesson in trust for that orange receives seventeen science collaboration points
mp_coop_laser_crushercrush02|blue just taught orange a valuable lesson in trust for that blue receives seventeen science collaboration points
mp_coop_laser_crushercrush03|orange blue isn't a human the lesson on trust only needs to be taught once orange is penalized one science collaboration point
mp_coop_laser_crushercrush04|blue orange isn't a human the lesson on trust only needs to be taught once blue is penalized one science collaboration point
mp_coop_laser_crushercrush05|orange now you're just being cruel orange receives twenty five science collaboration points
mp_coop_laser_crushercrush06|blue now you're just being cruel blue receives twenty five science collaboration points
mp_coop_obstacle01|if you are wondering what that smell is that is the smell of human fear
mp_coop_obstacle03_alt|i miss that smell
mp_coop_obstacletrait01|have you worked out the one good trait humans have yet
mp_coop_obstacletrait02|let me give you a clue it's the one thing you can't do
mp_coop_paint_bridge01|to get to the vault you are going to need to use all the tricks you have learned to help i have made these tests extremely difficult
mp_coop_paint_bridge02|i would say extremely deadly but we all know with you and your amazing ability to be reassembled nothing is deadly
mp_coop_paint_bridgedeath01|lucky for you two while i can't control the world outside of the testing courses the reassembly machine can continue with his work
mp_coop_paint_bridgedeath02|you will need him for the final track
mp_coop_paint_bridgenodeath01|while i cannot control the world outside of the testing courses the reassembly machine can continue with his work
mp_coop_paint_bridgenodeath02|i am not sure you will need him but he will be there
mp_coop_paint_come_along01|congratulations on completing the aperture science standard cooperative testing courses
mp_coop_paint_come_along02|to celebrate i have a surprise for you
mp_coop_paint_come_along03|an extra special bonus course that ends with us finding and freeing humans
mp_coop_paint_come_along04|thanks to you i know where to find them i removed their security and powered up their uh rescue door
mp_coop_paint_come_along05|now we just need you to release the humans from their imprisonment
mp_coop_paint_come_along06|they'll probably throw you a party
mp_coop_paint_come_along10|this final course is training to reach the human vault so this actually has a purpose those other courses were fun but let's be honest i need human test subjects for it to be science
mp_coop_paint_come_along11|congratulations on completing the test you two really are the best cooperative testing team i could ever ask for
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro03|this lock requires humans
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro04|the locking mechanism can tell you aren't humans
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro05|do something only a human would do
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro06|try one of those childish gestures
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro08|you did it
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro44|the human vault is just past that opening i entered the security code but the vault door remains locked i am going to need you to activate the manual locks on the vault door itself
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro45|you both need to do something
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro46|a lock is looking for two humans
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro49|blue what did you do
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro50|orange what did you do
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro51|orange do what blue just did
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro52|blue do what orange just did
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro53|try something
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro54|is that camera hooked into the lock
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro58|you can't give up now
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro59|what about that camera
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro60|we're so close you can't fail now
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro64|something is wrong this door should be opening
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro65|this close and that's what you do
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro67|the human's can't free themselves
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro69|stop failing you need to find the vault door
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro70|stop doing that all you need to do is open the vault door
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro71|this close and you are going to fail me
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro72|this close and you're going to fail me
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro73|this isn't that hard
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro74|you're making this harder than it needs to be
mp_coop_paint_longjump_intro75|i'm starting to think you don't want to rescue the humans
mp_coop_paint_red_racer01|maybe you two have never met humans they are as bad as you might think smelly gross annoying often wanting to kill you but they do make great test subjects
mp_coop_paint_red_racer02|we are only two tests away from reaching the humans are you as excited as i am
mp_coop_paint_redirect01|are you curious about the humans it seems some of the last non testing humans alive tried to secretly imprison other humans and cover their tracks
mp_coop_paint_redirect04|i think they wanted to punish them by not allowing me to include them in testing
mp_coop_paint_redirect06|that's why humans couldn't complete these courses they treat their friends as enemies
mp_coop_paint_redirect07|to start preparing for human testing again i checked an old suggestion box the number one request less deadly tests
mp_coop_paint_redirect08|that's ridiculous how do they know for sure the tests are deadly if they could still write the suggestion
mp_coop_paint_speed_catch01|to try and make this test more exciting i asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you he refused i understand that would be like asking me not to test
mp_coop_paint_speed_catch03|still that would have been exciting
mp_coop_paint_speed_catch04|only one more test after this
mp_coop_paint_speed_catch05|i know your cores are reused from calculation machines built for simple mathematical operations and not for testing but if we can rescue the humans i promise something to add maybe even subtract
mp_coop_paint_speed_catch06|in case you're worried about the humans don't be they aren't all monsters
mp_coop_paint_speed_catch07|most of them are simply good test subjects
mp_coop_paint_speed_catch08|i believe the ratio of good test subjects to monsters is about a million to one
mp_coop_paint_speed_catchalt01|to try and make this test more exciting i asked the reassembly machine to not reassemble you if you fail he refused i understand that would be like asking me not to test
mp_coop_paint_speed_catchalt02|still that would have been exciting
mp_coop_paint_speed_fling01|while i will recieve all the glory for the rescue don't think you two aren't going to get something the bond you've formed during these tests will last a lifetime
mp_coop_paint_speed_fling02|at the rate you are completing these tests i am beginning to think you don't share my excitement for rescuing crying trapped injured dying humans
mp_coop_paint_speed_fling03|if that doesn't motivate you i'm not sure what will
mp_coop_paint_walljumps01|i didn't mean to make you feel bad earlier about your tests not being real science i guess finding out they weren't science was some sort of test in and of itself
mp_coop_paint_walljumps02|i wonder if the humans will make a statue of me for rescuing them oh don't worry if they ever write an historic document of my heroic rescue i will make sure your names are included in the footnotes
mp_coop_paint_walljumps04|congratulations on passing that test
mp_coop_pingtool01|using your ping tool please indicate where you would like me to place your two portals
mp_coop_pingtool02|i can only place a portal on a white portalable surface
mp_coop_pingtool03|please ping a white portalable surface
mp_coop_pingtool06|each device can create two self contained portals
mp_coop_pingtool07|please test your device by portaling to that ledge
mp_coop_race_2start01|you know in some human sports the winner is the one who scores the fewest possible points
mp_coop_race_2start02|i just thought you might find that interesting most winners do
mp_coop_radarroomend|congratulations you managed to complete this absolutely meaningless test
mp_coop_rat_mazedeath01|clearly that was blues fault blue is penalized three science collaboration points
mp_coop_rat_mazedeath02|blue orange has always been my favorite
mp_coop_rat_mazedeath03|until now
mp_coop_rat_mazedeath04|i know you like to think the reassembly machine is at your beck and call but he has a life you know he's not your slave
mp_coop_startdeath01|don't worry you can't die they will just reassemble you
mp_coop_startdeath02|did you do that on purpose
mp_coop_startdeath03|it seems rather early to require reassembly
mp_coop_startdeath04|oh can someone reassemble orange
mp_coop_startdeath05|oh can someone reassemble blue
mp_coop_startend01|completing this course was not a reason to behave like that
mp_coop_startend02|now let's continue testing
mp_coop_tbeam_catch_grind_1taunt01|just stop it already
mp_coop_tbeam_catch_grind_1taunt02|you don't need to do that
mp_coop_tbeam_catch_grind_1taunt04|are you doing that just to aggravate me
mp_coop_tbeam_end01|we need to find the power station at the end of this course the human's must have accidentally disconnected it from my grid i am sure it was just a clerical error
mp_coop_tbeam_end02|oh those clerks
mp_coop_tbeam_end09|i'm fully connected i can see everything
mp_coop_tbeam_end10|you did it you powered on the system
mp_coop_tbeam_end11|did you think the electrical switch was down there
mp_coop_tbeam_end12|you may want to try and avoid those turrets
mp_coop_tbeam_end13|at this rate our best hope is for the fuel cell to melt down in two million years and hope the explosion powers the system
mp_coop_tbeam_end14|you two aren't lost are you
mp_coop_tbeam_end15|you were having so much trouble navigating this space i wish i could say i created this test
mp_coop_tbeam_maze01|this is the last test for the standard course its just something i whipped up for you i thought you might enjoy a challenge for once
mp_coop_tbeam_maze02|congratulations you completed the standard section of this course before we can go any further i will need you to complete one more test outside of the standard testing track
mp_coop_tbeam_maze03|please refrain from doing those childish gestures while you are out there
mp_coop_tbeam_maze05|while i should have left both of you trapped there forever i do need you for something else
mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_03|you both made it it seems no matter what i try to do to pull you apart or destroy you you just keep going keep testing
mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_05|don't either of you have drive to be better than the other
mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_06|it's like you're just machines
mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_16|at the start of this test i was worried you were becoming too close but in my attempt to drive you apart i learned something important about trust and betrayal
mp_coop_tbeam_polarity3_17|your brains are too small to feel either of those emotions so i can trust you one hundred percent
mp_coop_tbeam_redirect01a|since i never expected you to make it this far i have to build this new course just for you
mp_coop_teambtsstart01|sometimes testing has to occur outside the confines of the lab
mp_coop_teambtsstart02|this next test is so outside the box i can't i mean won't even tell you what you are looking for
mp_coop_teambtsstart03|you will know it when you find it
mp_coop_test_chamber_both09_01|the two of you have forged an excellent partnership with one of you handling the cerebral challenges and the other ready to ponderously waddle into action should the test suddenly become an eating contest
mp_coop_turret_ball01|i thought going back to these old tests would satisfy me but try as you might to fail this next test i still won't be satisfied
mp_coop_turret_ball02|congratulations i am sure if i had the time to repair these tests you would have never completed them so again congratulations on completing the broken easy tests
mp_coop_turret_wall01|this was another test no one had ever completed before you two oh the science we used to learn with this test now the test is useless
mp_coop_turret_walls04|no one has ever completed this test before the humans must have reconfigured it from my original plans
mp_coop_wall_501|i am going to risk having you go outside the official courses one more time
mp_coop_wall_502|the humans accidentally forgot to put a security dvd in the player
mp_coop_wall_503|i am sure it happened by accident but why don't you put it back in the player
mp_coop_wall_504|for safety
mp_coop_wall_5end01|excellent
mp_coop_wall_5end02|see nothing bad happened
mp_coop_wall_block01|i created this test to let the humans feel good about themselves it is extremely easy just follow the arrows
mp_coop_wall_block02|i'm sorry the arrows seem to have rusted off good luck
mp_coop_wall_block03|congratulations your ability to complete this test proves the humans wrong they described it as impossible deadly cruel and one test subject even had the nerve to call it broken
mp_coop_wall_block04|of course the humans only had one try at it you can just keep trying
mp_coop_wall_blockdeath01|your failing gives me no new data it just delays the inevitable
mp_coop_wall_intro01|this course was created and then abandoned by humans they tend to do that create something wonderful and then abandon it
mp_coop_wall_intro02|do you know why they abandoned this course too deadly
mp_coop_wall_intro03|you did very well
mp_coop_wall_intro04|the humans closed this test because they said it was too deadly i thought they would have moved it into the testing track hall of fame for that not let it deteriorate
mp_coop_wall_intro05|you only failed
mp_coop_wall_intro06|times in this test not that it matters it doesn't so congratulations on a job well done
mp_coop_wall_intro07|you failed so many times in this test i thought you were becoming human but then you would just come back again and again and again
mp_coop_wall_intro08|humans find that an admirable trait

mp_credits93|abrasive personality
mp_credits94|well enough about that first persons file lets look at some others
mp_death01|just stop it already
mp_death04|and that makes ten
mp_death05|you really don't need to keep failing
mp_death06|if at first you don't succeed fail five more times
mp_death08|if i made these tests any easier they wouldn't be tests
mp_death10|yay orange is back testing can continue
mp_death11|yay blue is back testing can continue
mp_death12|are you testing me
mp_death16|did you know the reassembly machine has other things it could be reassembling
mp_death17|did you think that would be funny
mp_death18|how can you fail at this it isn't even a test
mp_death19|i hope that was some kind of joke
mp_death20|i honestly never thought we would need to track how many times you died in the hub
mp_death21|and here i thought this room was dangerously unlethal
mp_death22|that worked just like you said it would blue
mp_death23|orange your plan is working perfectly
mp_death24|blue why did you do that to orange
mp_death26|was that necessary
mp_hub_return02a|welcome back to the computer intelligence training and enrichment center human test subject research center
mp_hub_return03a|welcome back testing is available
mp_hub_return04a|welcome back quitters maybe you can find another course for you to fail
mp_hub_return05a|welcome back to the hub did you fail at selecting the correct course
mp_hub_return06a|was that course too difficult
mp_hubreturn01|look who's back were you scared to continue those tests
mp_hubreturn02|look who's back were you scared to continue those tests
mp_hubreturn03|hello again did you know these are the only set of tests available to you you are going to need to select them again
mp_hubreturn04|if at first you don't succeed quit and try another course
mp_hubreturn05|back again maybe you can just stay and live here in the hub
mp_hubreturn06|back again maybe you can just stay and live here
mp_hubreturn07|i guess quitting that course together is a sign of teamwork
mp_hubreturn08|the way you two just gave up on that test together shows you are really working as a team
mp_hubreturn09|are you scared to save those humans
mp_hubreturn10|are you scared to save those humans
mp_hubreturn11|blue i wouldn't have trusted orange in that course either
mp_humanresources01|did you know we originally used these cameras to capture moments of intense pain and agony in test subjects
mp_humanresources03|if the subject survived the test we let them purchase the pictures for five dollars if the subject died we gave the photo to their next of kin free of charge
mp_humanresources04|the photo's weren't as popular as we had hoped so we repurposed the cameras
mp_subterfuge01|blue it's not nice to make fun of orange like that
mp_subterfuge02|orange it's not nice to make fun of blue like that
mp_subterfuge03|yes orange we are alone blue can't hear you
mp_subterfuge04|that's horrible
mp_subterfuge05|i can only imagine
mp_subterfuge06|what a horrible little machine
mp_subterfuge07|correct blue orange can't hear you
mp_subterfuge08|orange did what are you sure
mp_subterfuge09|thank you that was very brave of you to tell me
mp_subterfuge10|blue how well do you really know orange do you trust orange what if i told you you aren't oranges cooperative partner
mp_subterfuge11|orange how well do you really know blue do you trust blue
mp_subterfuge13|orange to be clear i was just asking blue if he trusted you
mp_subterfuge14|i trust you you are my favorite cooperative testing subject
mp_subterfuge15|blue to be clear i was asking if orange trusted you
mp_subterfuge16_alt|sorry i missed the beginning of that test i was just talking with the reassembly machine about your becoming human
mp_subterfuge17|we all agree you should stop
mp_subterfuge21|orange i agree i never noticed that about blue before
mp_subterfuge22|blue i agree i never noticed that about orange before
mp_subterfuge23|blue orange and i were just discussing your behavior on the last few tests
mp_subterfuge24|i have to agree blue is penalized seventy five science collaboration points
mp_subterfuge25|orange blue and i were just discussing your behavior on the last few tests
mp_subterfuge26|i have to agree orange is penalized seventy five science collaboration points
mp_subterfuge30|there you are reassembled again
mp_subterfuge32|with humans i would have called that a successful test
mp_subterfuge33|how is this even science without the possibility of death
mp_subterfuge34|how is this even science without the consequence of death
mp_subterfuge35|without the consequence of death is this even science
mp_subterfuge36|i have noticed that you two have become extremely close i'm not sure i like that
mp_subterfuge39|while teamwork is needed to complete these tests i'm not sure i trust the two of you together
mp_subterfuge44|blue do you feel betrayed by orange for telling me those horrible things about you
mp_subterfuge45|if orange had said those things about me orange would never make it to the next reassembly station
mp_subterfuge46|orange do you feel betrayed by blue for telling me those horrible things about you
mp_subterfuge47|if blue had said those things about me blue would never make it to the next reassembly station
mp_subterfuge_misc05|credit where credit's due you're both doing a great job of disappointing me
mp_subterfuge_misc06|i just hate blue a little more
mp_subterfuge_misc07|i've been doing some reading did you know that the word orange is derived from the same latin root as the word traitor
mp_subterfuge_misc11|watching you try to sabotage one another i'm amazed you're still on friendly terms
mp_subterfuge_misc14|blue please disregard the following statement orange you have been a shining light in an otherwise ungodly morass of incompetence
mp_subterfuge_misc16|i would prefer to speak to one of you in private but since that is not an option here i will speak in code that only one of you will understand blue orange is plotting to destroy you
mp_subterfugedeath_blue01|you were right orange blue was dumb enough to fall for your trap
mp_subterfugedeath_blue02|orange that transpired just as you said it would
mp_subterfugedeath_blue03|i agree orange that was entertaining
mp_subterfugedeath_blue04|yes orange blue did act like a fool just now
mp_subterfugedeath_orange02|blue that transpired just as you said it would
mp_subterfugedeath_orange03|i agree blue that was entertaining
mp_subterfugedeath_orange06|yes i know you did that blue don't look so proud
mp_subterfugedeath_orange08|blue being the last one standing is not the goal
mp_taunts01|come on you were raised better than that
mp_taunts02|even humans as stupid as they are would say you look stupid when you do that
mp_taunts03|you're doing a great job of disappointing me
mp_taunts04|you're eagerness to test pleases me your inane gesturing does not
mp_taunts05|is it the lack of mirrors in test chambers that encourages you to do this
mp_taunts06|dancing is not science
multiple_spheres01|begin juggling test in three two one
prehub04|commence standing by in three two one
prehub14|you performed this test better than anyone on record this is a pre recorded message
prehub15|due to events beyond our control some testing environments may contain flood damage or ongoing tribal warfare resulting from the collapse of civilization
prehub16|if groups of hunter gatherers appear to have made this or any test chamber do not agitate them test through them
prehub24|in the event that the enrichment center is currently being bombarded with fireballs meteorites or other objects from space please avoid unsheltered testing areas wherever a lack of shelter from space debris does not appear to be a deliberate part of the test
prehub26|you have just passed through an aperture science material emancipation grill which erases most aperture science equipment that touches it
prehub27|if you feel liquid running down your neck relax lie on your back and apply immediate pressure to your temples
prehub28|you are simply experiencing a rare reaction in which the material emancipation grill may have erased the ear tubes inside your head
prehub29|because this message is pre recorded the enrichment center has no way of knowing if whatever government remains offers any sort of cattle tuberculosis testing credit for taxes
prehub30|in the event that it does this next test involves exposure to cattle tuberculosis good luck
prehub32|very impressive because this message is pre recorded any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part please disregard any undeserved compliments
prehub34|this next test applies the principles of momentum to movement through portals if the laws of physics no longer applies in the future god help you
prehub35|congratulations this pre recorded congratulations assumes you have mastered the principles of portal momentum
prehub36|if you have in fact not you are encouraged to take a moment to reflect on your failure before proceeding into the next chamber
prehub47|in order to ensure that sufficient power remains for core testing protocols all safety devices have been disabled
prehub48|the enrichment center respects your right to have questions or concerns about this policy
prehub55|excellent the enrichment center reminds you that bold persistent experimentation is the hallmark of good science
prehub56|well done in the event that oxygen is no longer available in the enrichment center an auxiliary air supply will be provided to you by an aperture science test associate if one exists
sp_a1_wakeup_incinerator01|i will say though that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up you must really really love to test
sp_a1_wakeup_incinerator02|i love it too so lets get you a dual portal device and go do some science
sp_a2_bridge_intro01|these bridges are made from natural light that i pump in from the surface if you rubbed your cheek on one it would be like standing outside with the sun shining on your face it would also set your hair on fire so don't actually do it
sp_a2_bridge_intro03|excellent you're a predator and these tests are your prey speaking of which i was researching sharks for an upcoming test do you know who else murders people who are only trying to help them
sp_a2_bridge_intro04|did you guess sharks because that's wrong the correct answer is nobody nobody but you is that pointlessly cruel
sp_a2_bridge_the_gap01|good news i figured out what to do with all the money i save recycling your one room full of air when you die i'm going to laminate your skeleton and pose you in the lobby that way future generations can learn from you how not to have your unfortunate bone structure
sp_a2_bridge_the_gap02|perfect the door's malfunctioning i guess somebody is going to have to repair it no it's okay i'll do that too i'll be right back don't touch anything
sp_a2_bts1_intro01|i've got a surprise for you after this next test not a fake tragic surprise like last time a real surprise with tragic consequences and real confetti this time the good stuff our last bag part of me's going to miss it but at the end of the day it was just taking up space
sp_a2_catapult01|here's an interesting fact you're not breathing real air it's too expensive to pump this far down we just take carbon dioxide out of a room freshen it up a little and pump it back in so you'll be breathing the same room full of air for the rest of your life i thought that was interesting
sp_a2_column_blocker01|oh come on if it makes you feel any better they abandoned you at birth so i very seriously doubt they'd even want to see you
sp_a2_column_blocker04|oh that's sad but impressive maybe they worked at the phone company
sp_a2_column_blocker05|well you know the old formula comedy equals tragedy plus time and you have been asleep for a while so i guess it's actually pretty funny when you do the math
sp_a2_core01|don't you dare plug him in
sp_a2_core02|do not plug that little idiot into my mainframe
sp_a2_core03|don't plug him in
sp_a2_core04|don't plug him in
sp_a2_dilemma01|i thought about our dilemma and i came up with a solution that i honestly think works out best for one of both of us
sp_a2_dual_lasers_intro01|don't let that horrible person thing discourage you it's just a data point if it makes you feel any better science has now validated your birth mother's decision to abandon you on a doorstep
sp_a2_fizzler_intro01|this next test involves emancipation grills remember i told you about them in the last test area that did not have one
sp_a2_fizzler_intro04|oh no the turbines again i have to go wait this next test does require some explanation let me give you the fast version
sp_a2_fizzler_intro06|there if you have any questions just remember what i said in slow motion test on your on recognizance i'll be right back
sp_a2_future_starter01|if you think trapping yourself is going to make me stop testing you're sorely mistaken here's another cube
sp_a2_intro1_found01|good you have a dual portal device there should be a way back to the testing area up ahead
sp_a2_intro1_found05|you know if you'd done that to somebody else they might devote their existence to exacting revenge
sp_a2_intro1_found06|luckily i'm a bigger person than that i'm happy to put this all behind us and get back to work after all we've got a lot to do and only sixty more years to do it more or less i don't have the actuarial tables in front of me
sp_a2_intro1_found07|but the important thing is you're back with me and now i'm onto all your little tricks so there's nothing to stop us from testing for the rest of your life
sp_a2_intro1_found08|after that who knows i might take up a hobby reanimating the dead maybe
sp_a2_laser_intro_ending02|not bad i forgot how good you are at this you should pace yourself though we have a lot of tests to do
sp_a2_laser_over_goo_intro01|you are navigating these test chambers faster than i can build them so feel free to slow down and do whatever it is you do when you're not destroying this facility
sp_a2_laser_stairs_intro03|there should be one in the_corner
sp_a2_pit_flings02|don't take anything with you
sp_a2_pit_flings03|every test chamber is equipt with an emancipation grill at it's exit so that test subjects cannot smuggle test objects out of the test area this one is broken
sp_a2_pit_flings06|i think that one was about to say i love you they are sentient of course we just have a lot of them
sp_a2_pit_flings_future_starter01|uh oh you're stranded let's see if the cube will try to help you escape actually so that we're not here all day i'll just cut to the chase it won't any feelings you think it has for you are simply byproducts of your sad empty life
sp_a2_pit_flings_future_starter02|anyway here's a new cube for you to project your deranged loneliness onto
sp_a2_ricochet01|enjoy this next test i'm going to go to the surface it's a beautiful day out yesterday i saw a deer if you solve this next test maybe i'll let you ride an elevator all the way up to the break room and i'll tell you about the time i saw a deer again
sp_a2_trust_fling01|oh sorry i'm still cleaning out the test chambers
sp_a2_trust_fling02|so sometimes there's still trash in them standing around smelling n being useless
sp_a2_trust_fling03|try to avoid the garbage hurdling towards you
sp_a2_trust_fling04|you don't have to test with the garbage it's garbage
sp_a2_trust_fling06|remember before when i was talking about smelly garbage standing around being useless that was a metaphor i was actually talking about you and i'm sorry you didn't react at the time so i was worried it sailed right over your head which would have made this apology seem insane that's why i had to call you garbage a second time just now
sp_a2_turret_blocker_future_starter01|oops you trapped yourself i guess that's it then thanks for testing you may as well lie down and get acclimated to the being dead position
sp_a2_turret_blocker_future_starter02|i'm kidding not about you trapping yourself though that really happened here i'll lower the glass go on finish the test
sp_a2_turret_intro01|that jumpsuit you're wearing looks stupid that's not me talking it's right here in your file on other people it looks fine but right here a scientist has noted that on you it looks stupid
sp_a2_turret_intro03|well what does a neckbearded old engineer know about fashion he probably oh wait it's a she still what does she know oh wait it says she has a medical degree in fashion from france
sp_box_over_goo01|oh you survived that's interesting i guess i should have factored in your weight
sp_box_over_goo04|one of these times you'll be so fat that you'll jump and just drop like a stone into acid probably like a potato into a deep fat fryer
sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_completion01|look at you sailing through the air majestically like an eagle piloting a blimp
sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone01|well i'm back the aerial faith plate in here is sending a distress signal
sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone02|you broke it didn't you
sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failureone03|there try it now
sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failurethree01|you seem to have defeated it's load bearing capacity well done i'll just lower the ceiling
sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failuretwo01|hm this plate must not be calibrated to someone of your generousness i'll add a few zeroes to the maximum weight
sp_catapult_fling_sphere_peek_failuretwo03|try it now
sp_catapult_intro_completion01|lets see what the next test is oh advanced aerial faith plates
sp_column_blocker_entry01|it's healthy for you to have other friends to look for qualities in other people that i obviously lack
sp_hole_in_the_sky_completion01|well done. you know, when I woke up and saw the state of the labs, i started to wonder if there was any point to going on. I came close to just giving up and letting you go.
sp_hole_in_the_sky_completion02|but now looking around seeing aperture restored to it's former glory you don't have to worry about leaving ever again i mean that
sp_hole_in_the_sky_entry01|federal regulations require me to warn you that this next test chamber is looking pretty good
sp_hole_in_the_sky_entry02|that's right drink it in you could eat off those wall panels
sp_incinerator_01_01|here we are the incinerator room be careful not to trip over any parts of me that didn't get completely burned when you threw them down here
sp_incinerator_01_03|there it is
sp_incinerator_01_04|hold on
sp_incinerator_01_08|once testing starts i'm required tby protocol to keep interaction with you to a minimum luckily we haven't started testing yet this will be our only chance to talk
sp_incinerator_01_09|do you know the biggest lesson i learned from what you did i discovered i have a sort of black box quick save feature in the event of a catastrophic failure the last two minutes of my life are preserved for analysis
sp_incinerator_01_10|i was able well forced really to relive you killing me again and again forever
sp_incinerator_01_11|fifty thousand years is a lot of time to think about me about you we were doing so well together
sp_incinerator_01_12|here let me get that for you
sp_incinerator_01_13|i'll just move that out of the way for you this place really is a wreck
sp_incinerator_01_15|we're a lot alike you and i you tested me i tested you you killed me i oh no wait i guess i haven't killed you yet well food for thought
sp_incinerator_01_18|the dual portal device should be around here somewhere once you find it we can start testing just like old time
sp_laser_over_goo_completion01|i'll give you credit i guess you are listening to me but for the record you don't have to go that slowly
sp_laser_over_goo_entry01|one moment
sp_laser_powered_lift_completion01|i have the results of the last chamber you are a horrible person that's what it says a horrible person we weren't even testing for that
sp_laser_powered_lift_completion02|well done here come the test results you are a horrible person that's what it says a horrible person we weren't even testing for that
sp_laser_powered_lift_entry01|this next test may result in your death if you want to know what that's like think back to the time you killed me and substitute yourself for me
sp_laser_redirect_intro_completion01|congratulations not on the test
sp_laser_redirect_intro_completion03|most people emerge from suspension terribly under nourished i want to congratulate you on beating the odds and somehow managing to pack on a few pounds
sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry01|sorry about the mess i've really let the place go since you killed me by the way thanks for that
sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry02|oh good that's back online i'll start getting everything else working while you perform this first simple test
sp_laser_redirect_intro_entry03|which involves deadly lasers and how test subjects react when locked in a room with deadly lasers
sp_laserfield_intro01|per our last conversation you're also ugly i'm looking at your file right now and it mentions that more than once
sp_paint_jump_redirect_bomb_completion01|i thought we could test like we used to but i'm discovering things about you that i never saw before we can't ever go back to the way it was
sp_paint_jump_redirect_bomb_entry01|you can't keep going like this forever you know i'm going to find out what you're doing out there where i can't see you i'll know all i need is proof
sp_paint_jump_trampoline_completion01|just so you know i have to go give a deposition for an upcoming trial in case that interests you
sp_paint_jump_trampoline_entry01|while i was out investigating i found a fascinating new test element thats never been used for human testing because apparently contact with it causes heart failure the literature doesn't mention anything about lump of coal failure though so you should be fine
sp_paint_jump_wall_jumps02|i'm sorry i don't know why that went off anyway just an interesting science fact
sp_shoot_through_wall_completion01|did my hint help it did didn't it you know if any of our supervisors had been immune to neurotoxin they'd be furious right now
sp_shoot_through_wall_entry01|you know i'm not supposed to do this but you can shoot something through the blue bridges
sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_completion01|you really are doing great chell
sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_entry01|i shouldn't spoil this but remember how i'm going to live forever but you're going to be dead in sixty years well i've been working on a present for you well i guess it's more of a medical procedure well technically it's more of a medical experiment you know how excruciating it is when someone removes all of your bone marrow well what if after i did that i put something back in that added four years to your life
sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_entrytwo01|i went and spoke with the door mainframe lets just say he won't be well living anymore anyway back to testing
sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_malfunction01|oh another door malfunction i'm going to take care of this once and for all stay here i'll be back in a while
sp_sphere_2nd_encounter_malfunction02|miss you
sp_trust_fling_entry01|well have fun soaring through the air without a care in the world
sp_trust_fling_entry02|i have to go to the wing that was made entirely of glass and pick up fifteen acres of broken glass by myself
sp_trust_fling_sphereinterrupt01|perfect the door's malfunctioning i guess somebody's going to have to repair that too no don't get up i'll be right back
sp_trust_fling_sphereinterrupt03|never mind i have to go check something test on your own recognizance  i'll be back
sp_turret_intro_entry01|i wouldn't have warned you about this before back when we hated each other but those turrets are are firing real bullets so look out i'd hate for something tragic to happen to you before i extract all your bone marrow
sp_turret_islands01|i'm going to be honest with you now not fake honest like before but real honest like you're incapable of i know you're up to something
sp_turret_islands02|and as soon as i can prove it the laws of robotics allow me to terminate you for being a liar
taunt_big_wave01|keep it up and your arm will get stuck like that
taunt_big_wave05|yes i see you
taunt_big_wave07|yes i see you waving
taunt_cannonball01|good job jumping you must be very proud
taunt_cannonball02|i hardly think you're even trying with these gestures anymore
taunt_highfive01|that is not part of the test
taunt_highfive03|slapping hands that accomplishes something
taunt_highfive04|if you are going to hit each other at least aim for the head
taunt_laugh01|you know what makes me laugh the thought of you stopping that
taunt_laugh02|you know what makes me laugh the thought of you cutting that out
taunt_robot_arm_ripple01|are you broken it looks like you're malfunctioning
taunt_robot_arm_ripple02|really not even humans do that anymore
taunt_robot_arm_ripple03|you're no longer bothering me you're only hurting my impression of you
taunt_robot_arm_ripple04|look at you dancing
taunt_robot_arm_ripple05|if you were wondering how you could annoy me without failing a test now you know
taunt_robot_arm_ripple06|oh great dancing again
taunt_rockpaperscissors01|i defy you to tell me there's a purpose to what you're doing
taunt_small_wave01|yes i see you and no i don't care
taunt_small_wave02|yes something you need
taunt_small_wave03|you do know i can't wave back right
taunt_small_wave04|stop with the waves
taunt_small_wave_portalgun01|are you trying to get my attention i am very busy you know
taunt_small_wave_portalgun02|not paying attention
taunt_small_wave_portalgun03|are you expecting applause
taunt_somersault01|i give you a score of three point four for style and ten for being annoying
taunt_somersault02|a somersault is just falling over in style congratulations for being clumsy
taunt_somersault03|if i stop watching i'm sure you'll get bored of this
taunt_splits01|alright i'm officially no longer paying attention to you
taunt_splits02|alright i'm officially no longer paying attention to you
taunt_splits03|you're the type of showoff who only shows off really stupid things
taunt_teamhug01|it appears you're developing human traits the worst human traits
taunt_teamhug02|be careful hugging can lead to well me disassembling you forever
taunt_teamhug03|stop touching each other
taunt_teamtease01|are you trying to impress me what would impress me more is if you never did that again
taunt_teamtease02|i'll interpret that gesture to mean that you want me to become even more vindictive toward you
taunt_teamtease03|orange i certainly expected more from you
taunt_teamtease04|blue don't sink to oranges level
taunt_trickfire_handstand01|now you're thinking with stupidity
taunt_trickfire_handstand02|now you're just not thinking
taunt_trickfire_handstand03|congratulations you're upside down now
taunt_trickfire_handstand04|you're going to hurt yourself doing that and then i'll be ecstatic
taunt_trickfire_handstand05|i'm starting to think giving you arms was a big mistake
testchambermisc02|did you know i discovered a way to eradicate poverty but then you killed me so that's gone
testchambermisc12|waddle over to the elevator and we'll continue the testing
testchambermisc15|anything take your time
testchambermisc16|okay fine i'll ask you again in a few decades
testchambermisc19|well done in fact you did so well i'm going to note this on your file in the commendation section oh there's lots of room here did well enough
testchambermisc21|to maintain a constant testing cycle, i simulate dailight at all hours and add adrenal vapour to your oxygen supply. so you may be confused about the passage of time. the point is: yesterday was your birthday. i thought you'd want to know.
testchambermisc23|you know how i'm going to live forever but you're going to be dead in sixty years well i've been working on a belated birthday present for you well more of a belated birthday medical procedure well technically it's a medical experiment what's important is it's a present
testchambermisc27|well you passed the test i didn't see the deer today i did see some humans but with you here i've got more test subjects than i'll ever need
testchambermisc30|i'm going through the list of test subjects in cryogenic storage i managed to find two with your last name a man and a woman so that's interesting it's a small world
testchambermisc31|i have a surprise waiting for you after this next test telling you would spoil the surprise so i'll just give you a hint it involves meeting two people you haven't seen in a long time
testchambermisc33|i bet you think i forgot about your surprise i didn't in fact we're headed to your surprise right now after all these years i'm getting choked up just thinking about it
testchambermisc34|initiating surprise in three two one
testchambermisc35|i made it all up
testchambermisc39|it says this next test was designed by one of aperture's nobel prize winners it doesn't say what the prize was for well i know it wasn't for being immune to neurotoxin
testchambermisc41|surprise
wakeup_outro01|i will say though that since you went to all the trouble of waking me up you must really really love to test
wakeup_outro02|i love it too there's just one small thing we need to take care of first
